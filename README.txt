This is a simple example of gridview scrolling by the application.
It has a gridview consisting of 1024 buttons, a previous row and a next
row button.  Clicking a button scrolls the view so the button is at the 
top of the view.  Clicking next row scrolls up one row, clicking
previous row scrolls down by one row.

Use it as you wish.  It's just a simple example.
